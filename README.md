The purpose of this analysis was to retrieve weather data for cities throughout the world by generating random latitudes and longitudes, retrieving the nearest city and performing an API call with OpenWeatherMap website to gather detailed weather information about each city. From this list of random cities, the results were filted based on user input for minimul and maximum temperature preferences in order to generate a new list of potential vacation destinations. Finally, from the list of potential vacation cities, four locations were chosen to create a travel itenerary and plot the travel route as well as display citiy information on a marker layout map using Google Maps and the available API's from the Google Cloud Platform.
